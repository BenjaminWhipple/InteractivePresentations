# Interactive Presentations

These contain python notebook "presentations" are or have been used to communicate programming or scientific techniques to other lab members, peers, or mentees. These presentations are not necessarily original, nor optimal for the subject matter.

The "Complete" folder contains documents and code which I judge to be sufficiently complete to demonstrate the intended point. This does not mean to imply that they will not undergo further development.

The "Under Construction" folder contains drafts and ideas for other presentations, which should not be understood to be correct or complete in any way.
